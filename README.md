A game created by [Zachary Thompson](https://github.com/zt7466) and edited by [Abraham Loscher](https://github.com/abeloscher) and [Christopher Boyer](https://github.com/ChrisoftheBoyerClan). The game was entered in the Music and Gaming Festival 2017 and demoed at Too Many Games 2016.

The goal of the game is to destroy all of enemies approaching towards the center before they collide with you. Too many collisions and you're out. Matching the color of your bullets closer to the color of the enemies causes more damage.
